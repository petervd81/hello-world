# hello-world
First project on GitHub. Account created after deciding to reschool and change career from photography to IT

Before I started my photography career, I studied web-development at Grafisch Lyceum Rotterdam. 
Together with my friend Evert Slagter we learned ourselfs PHP. Our graduation project was MMSToday.nl, a platform to upload photos from your mobile phone through MMS to a 'profile' where other visitors could comment on your posts.
This was before Hyves/ Facebook.
We started a webdevelopment company called '1020Concepts'.
We graduated with a top score. 

Unfortunately I wasn't admitted to the bachelor studies CMD because my lack of graphic design skills (this was an Art Academy course). Evert did. 1020Concepts became a thriving development company, currently being the holding ltd of 'Tabs and Spaces' https://tabs-spaces.nl/
I wanted something completely different, theoretical. Social studies. After one year there I knew that wasn't for me. 
I switched to Photo Academy, wanting to make career in my other passion photography. 
In the next 12 years I learned at school, assisted various top photographers, traveled the world while assisting, and became an independent photographer. Every year was more succesful, very interesting jobs came along. Small portrait jobs for magazines, but also big advertising productions with me being the main contractor hiring various sub contractors.

The unsecurity of being a freelancer in a world where everyone can pick up a camera and be a photographer made me realise at 36 that to have a secure and interesting future, developing myself, providing for my family, I have to change career.
And what career can be better than going back into my other passion, the world of IT solving problems, programming, becoming a software engineer! The world of the future needs software engineers more than ever and always will be, and I can't wait to join the forces of professional software engineers.
